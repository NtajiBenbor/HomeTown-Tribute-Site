## My process
I Startded the project by first looking at the design file provided on figma, taking into account the various design elements and choices. Then  when i was ready, i started writing the HTML part to define the basic structure of the project. i Started with the hero section, editting the hero picture to the desired size i wanted. then i proceeded to the section area and designed three cards using CSS flexbox. eventually i concluded by designing the guide Card at the bottom of the page. i used the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to generate the color Palettes used for this project. s
