## My process
I started the project by first looking at the design file provided on Figma, taking into account the various design elements and choices. Then, when I was ready, I started writing the HTML part to define the basic structure of the project. I Started with the hero section, editing the hero picture to the size I wanted. Then I proceeded to the section area and designed three cards using CSS flexbox. Eventually, I concluded by designing the guide Card at the bottom of the page. i used the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to generate the color Palettes used for this project.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Photos from [pixel](https://www.pexels.com/)

### What I learned
  
  - I learned how to center elements using CSS flexbox.
  - I learned how to set and properly position a hero image.
